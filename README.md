## Project Overview

### Purpose

The Computer Programming Skill Swap Platform aims to solve the problem of finding personalized learning opportunities for computer programmers. Users can exchange skills with others through virtual sessions, avoiding high tutoring costs. The platform focuses on skill-sharing rather than traditional mentorship, offering tools for collaboration, reviews, and feedback.

### Key Features

**User Profile Pages:** Users can create and manage profiles with skill listings, expertise levels, and teaching packages.
**Skill Matching:** Interactive charts and filters suggest potential skill-swap partners.
**Swap Scheduling:** A calendar system allows users to schedule and confirm swap sessions.
**Rating & Review System:** Users can rate their swap sessions, providing feedback to others.
**Groups & Forums:** Create or join groups, participate in discussions, and learn in a collaborative environment.
**News & Trends:** Stay updated with the latest programming trends, tutorials, and resources.
**Secure Payment Gateway:** A secure payment system for users who wish to sell their educational materials.

### Main Features

**User Registration & Login:** Secure authentication system for user registration and login.
**Interactive Skill Matching:** Filters to sort potential swap partners based on programming languages, frameworks, and experience levels.
**Booking & Scheduling System:** Users can set their availability and request swap sessions via an integrated calendar.
**Review System:** After each swap, users can rate the session and provide feedback.
**Forum:** A community-driven discussion forum where users can ask questions and share experiences.
**Groups:** Users can form or join study groups based on their learning interests.
**Shopping:** Users can purchase or sell coding materials through the platformâ€™s online store.

**feature/<feature-name>:** Page-specific branches for development.
**Pull Requests:** Changes are merged into the develop branch via pull requests, with at least one peer review required for approval.

### Issues & Project Board:

10 issues are created and closed after functionality development.
GitHub issues (closed) link: https://github.com/NesliHumber/group9_project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed 

The project board is used to manage tasks and progress. 
Project Board Link: https://github.com/users/NesliHumber/projects/1/views/2

### Development Phases

Phase 1: Setup repository, implement user registration, and initial profile management.
Phase 2: Develop skill matching, swap scheduling, and user dashboard functionalities.
Phase 3: Add rating/review system, forums, and payment gateway.
Phase 4: Final testing, deployment, and bug fixing.

### Challenges & Solutions

Challenge 1: Integrating the Swap Scheduling Feature
Solution: We researched different calendar libraries and successfully integrated a custom solution to handle date/time selection and swap session confirmations.
Challenge 2: Payment Gateway Integration
Solution: After selecting a secure payment provider, we designed a user-friendly checkout flow and ensured smooth payment processing.
